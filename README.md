## Penda Health Typhoid cases analysis

This is an Excel analysis of data collected by Penda Health on **typhoid cases** of children under **5 years** of age in different clinics in Kenya.
-- _Penda health raw data.gsheet_ file contains the raw data collected.

-- _PendaHealth_data.xlsx_ file is the cleaned version using the R program in BIA analysis.R

-- _PendaHealthdata__Analysis.xlsx_ file is the final analysis of the data containing charts and tables of findings

-- _BI analysis.pbix_ file contains the insight analysis of the data set

> The Ministry of Health wanted to distribute free Typhoid vaccines to locations that recorded an average of 15 cases for children below 5 years of age through Penda Health. Therefore, through patient past records the organization is able to determine those locations through the following analysis. 

I used FIND and REPLACE, Ablebits tools,Text-to-Date formart conversion for cleaning and pivot tables, pivot charts and IF function for the analyses.

Below is the visualization insights derived from the dataset using **Power BI** that helped me make the decision.

The table below shows the records of patients below 5 years years old that were diagnosed with typhoid in the different locations.

From the table it is evident that **Embakasi**, **Githurai 45**, **Kahawa West**, **Umoja** and **Zimmerman** locations will receive the free typhoid vaccination from the Ministry of health.
